# EatMe Prompt-Driven Development Plan

The plan is **mobile-first with mock data**, then incremental backend + web expansion.  
Each phase includes clear validation points.  
**Total Timeline:** ~40 hours (focus on Phase 1 prototype; intermediate experience assumed).  
**Target Platforms:** iOS and Android.  
**Design:** Use Figma UI/UX designs for reference.  
**Budget:** Free/low-cost tools during dev; optimize for production costs.

## Current Strategy Snapshot

- Focus: Mobile app UX validation with mock data before backend spend.
- Why: Core value is map-first navigation and quick dish discovery.
- Backend readiness: Supabase planned; integrate only after UX validated.

## Setup & Getting Started

1. Initialize monorepo: `npx create-turbo@latest eatme --template` (create basic structure).
2. Set up mobile app: In `/apps/mobile`, run `expo init --template bare-minimum` (choose TypeScript).
3. Install dependencies: `npm install @rnmapbox/maps native-base zustand @react-navigation/native @react-navigation/drawer react-native-deck-swiper @react-native-async-storage/async-storage`.
4. Configure Mapbox: Get free API key from mapbox.com, add to app.json/env.
5. Run dev build: `expo run:ios` or `expo run:android` (test Mapbox integration early).
6. Cost control: use lightweight markers and avoid heavy images to limit Mapbox tile usage.
