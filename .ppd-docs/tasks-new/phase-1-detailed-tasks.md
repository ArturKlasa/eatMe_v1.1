# Phase 1: Mobile UI Prototype (No Backend) - Detailed Task Breakdown

Version: 1.0 – September 25, 2025

## Phase Overview

**Duration:** 4-5 weeks (~30-35 hours total)  
**Priority:** Critical - Foundation for entire project  
**Dependencies:** None (fresh start)  
**Key Deliverables:** Fully functional mobile app prototype with mock data, ready for user testing

**Current Status (September 29, 2025):**

- ✅ **Section 1.1 Complete:** Project Foundation & Tooling (4 tasks completed)
- ✅ **Section 1.2 Complete:** Mapbox Implementation (5/5 tasks completed)
- ✅ **Section 1.3 Complete:** Navigation & Drawer Menu (2 tasks completed)
- ⏳ **Next Priority:** Filter System Implementation (Section 1.4)

**Progress:** 11/27 tasks completed (41% complete)

**Improved Setup Strategy:**

- Node.js version management with Volta or nvm
- Monorepo-first approach with proper tooling setup
- Early ESLint/Prettier/TypeScript configuration
- Physical device testing emphasis
- Comprehensive Mapbox token setup

**Documentation Integration Principle:** Documentation is not a separate phase; EVERY task must update relevant docs (README, architecture notes, ADRs, usage instructions) and add/adjust code comments or JSDoc where logic is non-trivial. A task is incomplete if code changes are not reflected in documentation.

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Mapbox Integration Complexity:** Mitigation - Start with basic map, add features incrementally
- **Performance on Lower-end Devices:** Mitigation - Test on minimum spec devices early
- **React Native Version Compatibility:** Mitigation - Lock to specific RN version (0.73.x)

### Timeline Risks

- **Native Module Issues:** Mitigation - Budget extra time for iOS/Android specific issues
- **Design Iteration Time:** Mitigation - Focus on functionality first, polish later

### Quality Risks

- **Technical Debt Accumulation:** Mitigation - ESLint/Prettier from day one, regular code review
- **Insufficient Testing:** Mitigation - Manual testing on multiple devices throughout development

---

## Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies

- **Mapbox Account Setup:** Required for map functionality
- **Device Access:** Need iOS/Android devices for testing
- **Design Assets:** Figma designs for UI reference

### Internal Dependencies

- **Mock Data Quality:** Affects all features dependent on data
- **State Management Architecture:** Affects all features using global state

### Potential Blockers

- **Native Module Linking Issues:** Common with React Native
- **Platform-Specific UI Differences:** May require platform-specific code
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** May require optimization work
